-- Version issues using debian

	- NeoVim
	Make sure to install a version of NeoVim at least 0.5. It will need to be installed from source. Instructions are on the Git repo. Don't forget to git checkout stable. This will allow for Packer.nvim to be properly installed.
	Mason.nvim will need a new version of NPM to properly install some of the LSP servers. Fo this you need to run
		`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash`
	Then reboot the terminal.

	I think that was the cause of most of the issues.
